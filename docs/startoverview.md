## First of all you shall be able to login in Microsoft Office 365 :  
note I am using Office 365 Business, nevertheless O365 Business Essentials and O365 Enterprise plan shall let you do the same.    
1) go to login.microsoftonline.com  
![O365 Login screen](O365_login.png)  
2) once logged in you should see something similar to this  
![O365 Dashboard](O365_Dashboard.png)  
3) if you are admin you should see this icon :  
![O365 admin icon](O365_AdminIcon.png)  
4) Click on the Admin icon, to access the admin portal :  
![O365 admin portal](O365_AdminPortal.png)
5) Bottom of left pane you will have an icon, put your cursor on it :
![O365 super admin exchange](O365_SuperAdminIcon_Exchange.png)
6) Click on Exchange, to get access to outlook admin portal  
![Outlook admin portal](O365_Outlook_AdminPortal.png)

you will need to get to this Outlook Admin portal few times in this tutorial.

## Second verify you have ssh access to your Linux Box

1) I have a server hosted at sd-53250.dedibox.fr accessible on port 22
my unprivilege user is user  
 
```bash
$ssh sd-53250.dedibox.fr
Warning: Permanently added 'sd-53250.dedibox.fr' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

```  
2) now that we are in we want to see if we have root access (personnaly I leverage sudo to do so), it might ask you for your password to leverage sudo, in my case it doesn't (R.T.F.M ;) )  
 
```bash
$sudo su
#
```
3) you can type whoami to verify you are root  
 
```bash
# whoami
root
#
```  
4) we also want to verify bind9 is installed :  

```bash
# dpkg --list | grep ii | grep bind
ii  bind9                          1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u11           amd64        Internet Domain Name Server
ii  bind9-host                     1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u11           amd64        Version of 'host' bundled with BIND 9.X
ii  bind9utils                     1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u11           amd64        Utilities for BIND
ii  libbind9-90                    1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u11           amd64        BIND9 Shared Library used by BIND
```
5) if you have bind9 listed, it's ok, if not go we will install it :  

```bash
# apt-get install bind9
...
```  
6) once done redo the step with dpkg to verify it is listed as installed.  

You shall also have a new directory /etc/bind .For a fresh installed bind it shall looks like the below when listing the folder :  

```bash
# ls /etc/bind/
bind.keys  db.127	  db.255  db.root	  named.conf.default-zones
  named.conf.options	zones.rfc1918		db.0	
  db.empty	db.local  named.conf	named.conf.local	rndc.key
```  

Later on, we will work here in conjonction with O365 instructions.

## Third access your DNS provider (Gandi in my case)
1) Go to your provider, for me : <https://www.gandi.net/login> :  
![Gandi Login](GANDI_Login.png)  

2) On the upper Left Click on Services, then Domains :   
![Gandi Services Domains](GANDI_ServicesDomains.png)  

3) Click on the domain you want to associate with O365, in my case mobilutils.fr  
![Fandi mobilutils.fr details](GANDI_MobilutilsfrDetails.png)  

We will come here later on ;).

that's it for now you can go back to the main readme. [readme](../readme.md)
